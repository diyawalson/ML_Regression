**ðŸ“˜ Regression Projects Overview**

This repository includes a collection of machine learning projects focused on regression analysis, where the goal is to predict continuous numeric outcomes based on input features. Each project follows a structured approach involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

**ðŸ”§ Common Pipeline Across Projects:**

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding distributions, trends, and feature relationships

Correlation analysis to identify key predictors

Model Training

**Supervised regression algorithms such as:**

Linear Regression

Ridge and Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

**Model Evaluation:**

Metrics used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Root Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

RÂ² Score

**Model comparison and selection based on performance:**

Interpretation & Insights

Feature importance analysis

Practical use cases for each model

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective:**

To develop accurate, reliable, and interpretable machine learning models for real-world regression problems. These projects are designed to demonstrate end-to-end workflows that can be adapted for business applications, research, or production systems.
