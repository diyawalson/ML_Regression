**🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning regression techniques. Leveraging a structured dataset containing key real estate attributes like location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and more, the goal is to build accurate models that estimate house prices effectively.

**📊 Project Highlights:**

**✅ Data Preprocessing:**

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features to improve model performance

**📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Uncovered trends and patterns using graphs and correlation matrices

Identified important factors affecting house prices

**🤖 Model Building:**

Trained multiple regression models including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Compared models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score

**🧠 Model Evaluation & Insights:**

Assessed performance across models and selected the best one

Provided interpretation of key features influencing house pricing

**🎯 Objective:**

The main objective is to create a robust and interpretable machine learning pipeline that helps users or stakeholders estimate property prices based on input features. This project can serve as a foundation for building real estate pricing tools or integrating predictive analytics into housing platforms.
